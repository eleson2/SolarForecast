# Battery Optimizer — Design Document

## Overview

A module that decides **when to charge, discharge, or sell battery capacity** based on:

- Solar production forecast (from the Solar Forecast module)
- Electricity spot prices (15-min intervals, from pluggable price provider)
- Household consumption estimate (yesterday's actual usage, temperature-adjusted)
- Battery state and constraints

The goal: minimize electricity cost — or maximize revenue — by shifting energy use
across hours. Charge the battery when electricity is cheap or solar is abundant,
discharge when prices peak, and sell capacity back to the grid when profitable.

| Stale forecast fix       | Done        | `upsertReading` clears `prod_forecast`/`correction_applied` on irradiance update if no `prod_actual` yet; `getReadingsWithoutForecast` always returns future rows so every model run refreshes remaining-day forecasts |

## Inputs

### 1. Solar production forecast
From the Solar Forecast module — `GET /forecast` or direct DB access.

```
{ hour: "2026-06-15T12:00", avg_watts: 4200, confidence: 0.92 }
```

### 2. Electricity prices
Spot prices available in **15-minute intervals**, day-ahead. The price fetcher is
pluggable — each provider lives in `src/prices/<name>.js` and exports
`fetchPricesForDate(dateStr, region)`.

#### Implemented providers

| Provider         | Module                       | Markets              | Resolution | Auth   |
|------------------|------------------------------|----------------------|------------|--------|
| `elprisetjust`   | `src/prices/elprisetjust.js` | Nordics (SE/NO/DK/FI) | 15 min   | None   |
| `awattar`        | `src/prices/awattar.js`      | Germany, Austria     | 60 min → 4×15 min | None |

#### Future providers (not yet implemented)

| Market          | Source                        | Resolution   |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|--------------|
| UK              | Octopus Agile / ENTSO-E      | 30 min       |
| US              | Varies by ISO (CAISO, PJM)   | 5–15 min     |

15-minute resolution enables finer optimization than hourly — the optimizer can
shift loads to the cheapest quarter within an hour, which matters when prices
spike briefly (e.g. 17:00–17:15 vs 17:15–17:30 can differ significantly).

### 3. Household consumption estimate

**Two-layer approach: OLS daytime model + yesterday's actuals for nighttime**

**Daytime (08:00–18:00) — `consumption-learner.js`**

A single linear OLS regression is fitted across all daytime readings:
```
consumption_w = slope × outdoor_temp + intercept
```

Heat loss from a building is governed by the indoor/outdoor temperature differential,
not the time of day. One regression line across all daytime hours pools far more data
(11× more samples for the same number of days) than per-hour models would.

Refreshed hourly by `learnPipeline`. Requires ≥ 50 samples (~5 days) before activating.

Readings above `consumption.max_house_w` are excluded from the regression to prevent
EV charging sessions from corrupting the slope. Nighttime hours (19:00–07:00) are
excluded for the same reason — EV charging typically happens overnight.

The fitted slope and intercept are stored in the `consumption_model` table and logged
each run with R². A low R² (< 0.3) triggers a warning — this may be normal when
large variable loads (EV, oven) add uncorrelated variance.

**Nighttime (19:00–07:00) — yesterday's actual readings**

Yesterday's hourly actuals from `consumption_readings` are used directly for overnight
hours, where the temperature model is unreliable and EV charging spikes are excluded
from the regression anyway.

**Fallback**

If the model has fewer than 50 samples or the DB has no yesterday data, falls back
to `config.consumption.flat_watts` as a flat estimate.

### 4. Battery state
From inverter API or manual config:

- Current state of charge (SOC) in %
- Usable capacity in kWh
- Max charge rate in W
- Max discharge rate in W
- Round-trip efficiency (typically 85–95%)

**Live SOC seeding:** The optimizer accepts an optional `options.startSoc` (percentage)
parameter. When provided (from `driver.getState()`), the forward SOC pass starts from
the actual battery level instead of the conservative `min_soc` default. This produces
significantly better schedules when the battery is partially charged — e.g. at 60%
instead of the assumed 10%.

## Configuration

```javascript
// config.js (relevant sections)
export default {
    battery: {
        capacity_kwh: 10.0,        // usable capacity

        // 0.7 = apply 30% discount for forecast uncertainty (clouds, seasonal error).
        // Lower = more grid charging as insurance; higher = rely more on solar.
        solar_forecast_confidence: 0.7,

        // Minimum kWh of grid charging headroom to preserve regardless of solar forecast.

        // Maximum expected house consumption without EV charging (watts).
        // Daytime readings above this are excluded from the temperature regression,
        // preventing EV sessions from corrupting the consumption model slope.
        // Rule of thumb: peak heating load + all appliances, but not the EV charger.
        max_house_w: 5000,
    },

```

## Core Logic

### The optimization problem

For each 15-min slot in the next 24 hours, decide one of:

- **Charge from solar** — free energy, store excess production
- **Charge from grid** — buy cheap electricity now, use later
- **Discharge to house** — avoid buying expensive electricity
- **Sell to grid** — export stored energy at high prices
- **Idle** — do nothing, let solar cover consumption directly

### Decision factors per hour

```
net_production = solar_forecast - consumption_estimate    (watts)
buy_price      = spot_price + transfer_import + energy_tax  (per kWh)
sell_price     = spot_price × sell_factor − transfer_export (per kWh)
```

### Greedy strategy (v1) — solar-aware pairing

The optimizer pairs cheap charge slots with expensive discharge slots, but is
**solar-aware**: it only charges enough to cover actual grid deficits.

Before pairing, it computes how much of the battery's empty headroom solar is
expected to fill, and reserves the rest for grid charging:

```
solarAbsorbWh = min(solarSurplusWh × solar_forecast_confidence,
                    batteryRoomWh − min_grid_charge_kwh × 1000)
gridHeadroomWh = max(0, batteryRoomWh − solarAbsorbWh)
```

- `solar_forecast_confidence` (default 0.7) discounts the forecast to account for
  uncertainty — clouds, seasonal model errors.
- `min_grid_charge_kwh` (default 4.0 kWh) is a hard floor: even if the solar forecast
  is large enough to absorb the entire battery, this many kWh of headroom are always
  reserved for grid charging. **Exception:** if total forecast solar ≥ battery room +
  total forecast consumption, the floor is waived — solar alone will fill the battery
  and cover all loads, so grid charging is never needed.
- `max_solar_for_grid_charge_w` (default 100 W) restricts grid-charge candidate slots
  to hours where the solar forecast is below this watt threshold. Any slot forecasting
  more than 100 W of solar is excluded — the battery will charge for free via
  `charge_solar` so grid-charging there is wasteful. Night and heavy-overcast slots
  (≤ 100 W) remain eligible.

The optimizer logs this calculation on each run:
```
[optimizer] Solar-aware: 17.1 kWh forecast × 0.7 confidence = 3.7 kWh credited
            (cap 3.7 kWh), grid headroom 4.0 kWh
[optimizer] Cloud cover: avg 58% over 11 daytime forecast hours
```

#### Step 1: Compute avoidable energy per slot

For each 15-min slot, compute the grid deficit that a battery discharge could
displace:

```
net_production = solar_forecast - consumption_estimate   (watts)
grid_deficit   = max(0, -net_production)                 (watts needing grid)
avoidable_wh   = min(grid_deficit, max_discharge_w) × 0.25
```

Slots where solar covers consumption have `avoidable_wh = 0` — discharging
there wastes stored energy since there's nothing to displace.

#### Step 2: Filter candidates

- **Discharge candidates**: only slots with `avoidable_wh > 0`, sorted by
  `buy_price` descending (most expensive first)
- **Charge candidates**: slots where `net_production ≤ 0` AND `solar_watts ≤ consumption_watts × 0.5`
  (solar covering less than half of load), sorted by `buy_price` ascending (cheapest first).
  Excluding slots where solar already covers ≥50% of consumption prevents grid charging during
  the solar ramp-up window — those slots show up cheap in the price sort but grid-charging
  there competes with free solar and creates scattered short charge windows.

#### Step 3: Pair charge ↔ discharge

Pair cheapest charge with most expensive discharge while:
- Price spread exceeds efficiency loss: `discharge_price - charge_price > min_spread`
- Battery capacity not exceeded

Each pair's energy is capped to the discharge slot's `avoidable_wh` — the battery
only charges what it will actually use. This means:

- **Morning peak** (7–9, no solar) → high avoidable_wh → gets paired
- **Sunny midday** (solar surplus) → zero avoidable_wh → skipped entirely
- **Battery charges just enough** for the morning gap + any evening deficit

#### Step 4: Solar surplus & sell

After pairing, remaining idle slots with solar surplus get `charge_solar`.
If the battery is full and grid sell is enabled, surplus becomes `sell`.

#### Efficiency threshold

A charge/discharge cycle only makes sense when the price spread exceeds the
efficiency loss:

```
min_spread = buy_price × (1 / efficiency - 1)
// At 90% efficiency and 0.50 SEK/kWh buy price: min_spread ≈ 0.056 SEK/kWh
```

Only schedule a cycle when `discharge_price - charge_price > min_spread`.

## Database

### `consumption_readings` — one row per hour
Tracks actual household consumption for the "yesterday" model.

```sql
CREATE TABLE consumption_readings (
    hour_ts         DATETIME PRIMARY KEY,
    consumption_w   REAL,             -- actual consumption in watts
    outdoor_temp    REAL,             -- °C, for temperature correction
    source          TEXT              -- 'inverter', 'meter', 'computed', 'estimate'
);
```

### `price_readings` — one row per 15-minute slot
Stores spot prices at 15-minute resolution.

```sql
CREATE TABLE price_readings (
    slot_ts         DATETIME PRIMARY KEY,  -- e.g. "2026-06-15T17:15"
    spot_price      REAL,                  -- per kWh, in local currency
    region          TEXT
);
```

### `battery_schedule` — one row per 15-minute slot
The optimizer's output. 15-minute resolution matches price data and allows
finer control over charge/discharge timing.

```sql
CREATE TABLE battery_schedule (
    slot_ts         DATETIME PRIMARY KEY,  -- 15-min slot
    action          TEXT,                  -- idle, charge_solar, charge_grid, discharge, sell
    watts           REAL,
    soc_start       REAL,
    soc_end         REAL,
    price_kwh       REAL,
    solar_watts     REAL,
    consumption_watts REAL
);
```

## Scheduler

```
When day-ahead prices available → run optimizer, produce 24h schedule
Every 1 hour                   → re-optimize remaining hours with updated SOC
```

Day-ahead prices publish at different times per market — configured via
`config.price.day_ahead_hour` (UTC). The scheduler triggers 15 minutes after
that hour, then re-optimizes hourly as actuals deviate from forecast.

## Price Provider Configuration Examples

### Sweden (default)
```javascript
price: {
    source: 'elprisetjust',
    region: 'SE3',           // SE1–SE4
    currency: 'SEK',
    day_ahead_hour: 13,      // Nord Pool publishes ~13:00 CET
},
```

### Germany
```javascript
price: {
    source: 'awattar',
    region: 'DE',
    currency: 'EUR',
    day_ahead_hour: 13,
},
```

### Austria
```javascript
price: {
    source: 'awattar',
    region: 'AT',
    currency: 'EUR',
    day_ahead_hour: 13,
},
```

---

## Adding a New Provider

Create `src/prices/<name>.js` exporting one function:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} dateStr  - "YYYY-MM-DD"
 * @param {string} region   - Provider-specific region code
 * @returns {Promise<{ prices: Array<{slot_ts, spot_price, region}>, raw: any } | null>}
 */
export async function fetchPricesForDate(dateStr, region) { ... }
```

Requirements:
- Return `null` when prices aren't available yet (e.g. 404).
- `slot_ts` must be `"YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM"` in the configured timezone.
- `spot_price` must be per kWh in the local currency.
- Output exactly 96 slots (4 per hour × 24 hours). If the API returns hourly data,
  expand each hour into 4×15-min slots with the same price.
- Include raw API response in `raw` for archiving.

Then register the provider in `src/price-fetcher.js`:

```javascript
import * as myProvider from './prices/my-provider.js';
const providers = { elprisetjust, awattar, myProvider };
```

## Consumption Collection Pipeline

The `consumptionPipeline()` in `scheduler.js` collects real household consumption
from the inverter and stores it in `consumption_readings` for the "yesterday"
estimator to use.

### Interface

Drivers that support telemetry export a `getMetrics(driverConfig)` function
(optional — see [`inverter-integration.md`](inverter-integration.md)). It returns:

```javascript
{
  soc: number,            // battery SOC %
  battery_w: number,      // charge (+) / discharge (−) watts
  grid_import_w: number,  // watts drawn from grid
  grid_export_w: number,  // watts sent to grid
  solar_w: number,        // PV production watts
  consumption_w: number,  // household load watts
}
```

### Schedule

- **Cron:** `5 * * * *` (hourly at :05, avoids collision with learner at :00 and optimizer at :30)
- **Also runs on startup**

### Fallback

If the driver doesn't implement `getMetrics()` (`typeof driver.getMetrics !== 'function'`),
the pipeline is silently skipped. The consumption estimator falls back to flat watts
from config, as before.

## Modbus TCP Steering — SOC Buffer Control

### Overview

The `growatt-modbus` driver (`src/inverters/growatt-modbus.js`) communicates with the
inverter directly over Modbus TCP on the local network, replacing the cloud API used by
the `growatt` driver. This provides:

- **Low latency** — <100ms vs 1-5s cloud round-trip
- **No internet dependency** — works offline
- **Simple control** — single register write instead of 9 time segments

### How it works

Instead of managing time segments (the cloud API approach), the Modbus driver uses
**SOC buffer control** via a single holding register:

- **Holding register 3310** (`LoadFirstStopSocSet` / reserved SOC for peak shaving) —
  the SOC percentage at which the battery stops discharging to the load. The inverter
  is always in "Load First" mode; this register acts as the discharge floor.
  (Holding register 808 is a mirror. Growatt V1.24 doc says 3082, which doesn't work.)

The `applySchedule()` function translates optimizer actions to a target SOC value:

| Optimizer action         | SOC target                  | Effect                           |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `charge_grid` / `charge_solar` | `charge_soc` (default 90%) | High floor → battery charges     |
| `discharge` / `sell`     | `discharge_soc` (default 20%) | Low floor → battery discharges |
| `idle`                   | Current SOC                 | Holds current level              |

This runs every 15 minutes (via `executePipeline` in the scheduler), so the SOC floor
is continuously adjusted to match the current optimizer slot.

### Telemetry

The driver reads telemetry from three input register groups:

1. **Input registers 0–52** — Group 1: PV power, AC output, grid voltage/frequency
2. **Input registers 3021–3022** — Grid import power (one of the few working storage registers)
3. **Input registers 3169–3171** — BMS: battery voltage, current, SOC

Note: most storage input registers (3000–3040) return zeros on this datalogger.
Battery data comes from the BMS range (3169+) instead of the documented 3009–3014.

### Configuration

```javascript
inverter: {
    brand: 'growatt-modbus',
    host: '192.168.1.XXX',     // datalogger IP on local network
    port: 502,                  // Modbus TCP port
    unit_id: 1,                 // Modbus slave address
    dry_run: true,              // true = log only, false = write registers
    charge_soc: 95,             // SOC target for charge actions
    discharge_soc: 13,          // SOC floor for discharge actions
},
```

Set `dry_run: true` initially. When logs confirm correct behavior, switch to `false`.

### Connection management

The driver maintains a lazy singleton TCP connection with automatic reconnect.
A 1-second throttle between Modbus commands prevents overwhelming the datalogger.

Modbus operations run inside `withReconnect(fn)`, which retries up to `modbus_retries`
times (config-driven, default 3) with `modbus_retry_delay_ms` delay (default 4 s) between
attempts. The TCP client is destroyed and recreated on each retry to avoid stale state.
After all retries are exhausted, the error propagates to the caller.

### Transient error handling

When `executePipeline` catches a Modbus error:

- **Transient** (`ETIMEDOUT`, `ECONNREFUSED`, `timed out`): the inverter likely continued
  operating on the last-written register value. The pipeline logs a warning and exits
  **without** calling `resetToDefault` — interrupting an active charge/discharge for no
  reason would be worse than leaving the inverter alone.
- **Hard protocol errors**: `resetToDefault` is called as before.

### Last-known SOC fallback

`scheduler.js` maintains a module-level `lastKnownSoc` variable updated on every successful
`driver.getState()` call in both `batteryPipeline` and `executePipeline`. When a Modbus
timeout occurs, the optimizer uses `lastKnownSoc` instead of falling back to the pessimistic
`min_soc` default — which would otherwise cause the solar surplus calculation to assume
a nearly-empty battery and block all grid charging.

---

## Manual Override API

A persistent override keeps the inverter in a fixed mode for a requested duration,
surviving multiple 15-minute execute cycles.

### Endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/battery/override` | Get current override status |
| `POST` | `/battery/override` | Set override: `{ action, duration_minutes }` |
| `DELETE` | `/battery/override` | Cancel active override |

Valid actions: `charge`, `discharge`, `idle`. Duration: 1–1440 minutes.

### Behavior

- On `POST`: the driver action is applied immediately, then an in-memory expiry is set in
  `src/override.js`. Each `executePipeline` run checks `getOverride()` first — if active,
  it applies the override action and returns early (skipping schedule dispatch).
- Overrides expire automatically when `expires_at` is reached.
- Use the override for manual testing or emergency situations. For normal automation, rely on
  the schedule.

### SOC Deviation Guard

In addition to the manual override, `executePipeline` includes an automatic reactive
correction. After computing `futureSlots`, it checks:

```
if (slots[0].soc_start - state.soc > soc_deviation_threshold) AND (not already charging)
→ override futureSlots[0] to charge_grid at max_charge_w
```

This fires when actual battery SOC is significantly below what the optimizer planned —
e.g. unexpectedly high load during the night. The override lasts one 15-minute slot; the
subsequent `batteryPipeline` re-plans from the corrected SOC.

Configurable via `config.battery.soc_deviation_threshold` (default: 10 %).

## EV Charging

EV charging is handled externally via a **Home Assistant automation** that starts
the charger when there is a PV surplus. This software does not schedule or control
EV charging.

The main interaction point is the `consumption.max_house_w` threshold: readings
above this value are excluded from the daytime consumption regression, preventing
EV charging sessions from inflating the slope and corrupting future estimates.

No further EV integration is planned in this software.

## Peak Shaving — Design (v2)

### Problem

Many Swedish DSOs charge a monthly **peak power fee** (effektavgift) based on
the highest single-hour average power drawn from the grid during the month.
Typical tariffs: 40–80 SEK/kW/month. A 10 kW peak costs 400–800 SEK/month.

The battery can reduce peaks by discharging during high-consumption moments,
even when spot prices are low — the peak fee savings can outweigh the
spot-price arbitrage loss.

### Data model

New table `peak_readings`:
```sql
CREATE TABLE peak_readings (
    month       TEXT PRIMARY KEY,  -- "YYYY-MM"
    peak_w      REAL,              -- highest hour-average import watts this month
    peak_hour   DATETIME,          -- when the peak occurred
    updated_at  DATETIME
);
```

### Config

```javascript
grid: {
    // ... existing fields ...
    peak_fee_kw_month: 0,       // SEK/kW/month — 0 disables peak shaving
    peak_window_hours: [7,8,9,17,18,19],  // hours when peaks typically occur
},
```

### Algorithm — adaptive peak target

1. Track the current month's observed peak import power
2. At each optimization run, compute a **peak target** = current_peak × 0.95
   (try to stay below current peak, with margin)
3. For slots where consumption > peak_target:
   - Reserve battery capacity for discharge during those slots
   - Even if spot price is low — peak fee savings justify it
4. The cost of a new peak kW = `peak_fee_kw_month`
   - Added to the "virtual buy price" of high-consumption slots
   - Makes the optimizer prefer discharging to avoid setting new peaks

### Integration with optimizer

The peak shaving layer runs **before** the greedy pairing:
1. Identify slots where forecast consumption exceeds peak_target
2. Mark those slots as mandatory discharge (regardless of spot price)
3. Reserve battery Wh for those slots
4. Then run normal greedy pairing with remaining capacity

### What is implemented

The register write is live: `POST /battery/control/peak-shaving` calls
`driver.setPeakShavingTarget(limit_kw)` which writes to holding register 800.
The scheduler also writes the configured `peak_shaving.default_kw` value on startup
and can apply time-of-day schedule overrides.

### What is not yet implemented

The **autonomous optimizer integration** — tracking the monthly peak, reserving
battery capacity for peak-shaving slots, and incorporating peak fee savings into
the pairing algorithm — is not started. This requires reliable real-time grid
import readings (available via Modbus input 3021–3022) to track intra-hour peaks.

## Future Considerations

- **Optimal strategy (v2+)** — dynamic programming over 24h horizon for globally optimal schedule
- **Multi-day optimization** — look ahead 48h when prices are volatile
- **Grid capacity selling** — participate in frequency regulation markets
- **Multiple EVs** — household with two electric vehicles
- **Vehicle-to-grid (V2G)** — use EV battery as additional storage
- **Machine learning pricing** — predict price spikes from weather/demand patterns
- **Dashboard** — visualize schedule, savings, and battery state over time
